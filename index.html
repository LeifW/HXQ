<h1>HXQ: A Compiler from XQuery to Haskell</h1>
<h3>Download <a href="/HXQ-0.16.0.tar.gz">HXQ-0.16.0.tar.gz</a></h3>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
HXQ is a fast and space-efficient translator
from <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Query/">XQuery</a> (the standard
query language for XML) to embedded Haskell code. The translation is
based on <a href="http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Template_Haskell">Template
Haskell</a>. HXQ takes full advantage of Haskell's lazy evaluation to
keep in memory only those parts of XML data needed at each point of
evaluation, thus performing stream-based evaluation for forward
queries (queries that do not contain backward steps). This results to
an implementation that is as fast and space-efficient as any
stream-based implementation based on SAX filters or finite state
machines. Furthermore, the coding is far simpler and extensible since
it is based on XML trees, rather than SAX events.  Since HXQ uses lazy
evaluation, you get the first results of non-blocking queries
immediately, while the non-streaming XQuery processors must first parse the
entire input file and construct the whole XML tree in memory before
they produce any output.
<p>
Finally, HXQ can store XML documents in a relational database
(currently MySQL or SQLite), by shredding XML into relational tuples,
and by translating XQueries over the shredded documents into optimized
SQL queries. The mapping to relational tables is based on the
document's structural summary, which is derived from the document data
rather than from a schema.  It uses hybrid inlining to inline attributes
and non-repeating elements into a single table, thus resulting to a
compact relational schema. For each such mapping, HXQ synthesizes an XQuery
that reconstructs the original XML document from the shredded data.
This XQuery is fused with the user queries using partial evaluation
techniques and parts of the resulting query are mapped to SQL queries
using code folding rules so that all relevant predicates are promoted
to SQL. This pushes most evaluation to the database query engine, thus
resulting to a fast execution over large data sets.
<p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>
HXQ shines best when used for data intensive applications. For example,
the XQuery in <a href="Test2.hs">Test2.hs</a>, which is against
the <a href="http://dblp.uni-trier.de/xml/">DBLP XML document</a>
(420MB), runs in 36 seconds on my laptop PC and uses a maximum of
3.2MB of heap space (using the runtime options <tt>+RTS -H2m -M3.2m</tt>).
(All results are taken on an Intel Core 2 Duo
2.2GHz 2GB running ghc-6.8.3 on Linux 2.6.27 kernel.)  To contrast
this, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/qexo/">Qexo</a>, which
compiles XQueries to Java bytecode, takes 1 minute 17 seconds and uses
1400MB of heap space for the same query,
while <a href="http://xqilla.sourceforge.net/HomePage">XQilla</a>,
which is written in C++, takes 1 minute and 10 secs and uses 1150MB of
heap space.  For simple XPath queries, the fastest implementation I
have ever tried is
using <a href="http://lambda.uta.edu/cse5335/examples/sax.java">SAX
pipelines</a>, which runs in 17secs and needs 3MB heap. Unfortunately,
it is very hard to implement complex XQuery constructs
using <a href="http://lambda.uta.edu/XStreamQuery.pdf">SAX</a>,
and one may end up simulating lazy evaluation using ad-hoc techniques.
<p>
For better performance in data intensive applications, one may use the
database capabilities of HXQ.  For example, when the DBLP file is
shredded into a MySQL database and the appropriate index is created,
the above query runs in 90 milliseconds.
<p>
HXQ uses the <a href="http://www.flightlab.com/~joe/hxml/">HXML parser
for XML</a> (developed by Joe English), which is included in the
source. I have also tried hexpat, tagsoup, HXT, and HaXML Xtract, but
they all have space leaks.
<p>
HXQ has two parsers: one that generates simple rose trees from XML
documents, which can be processed by forward queries without space
leaks, and another parser where each tree node has a reference to its
parent.  Some, but not all, backward axis steps (such as the parent
axis /..) are removed from a query using optimization rules.  If there
are backward axis steps left in the query, then HXQ uses the latter
parser, which may result to a performance penalty due to space leaks.
<p>
<h2>Installation Instructions (HXQ without Database Connectivity)</h2>
<p>
HXQ can be installed on most platforms but I have only tested it on
Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows XP.  The simplest installation is without database
connectivity (ie, it can only process XQueries against XML text
documents). If you want database connectivity
(over MySQL or sqlite relational databases), look at the
<a href="db.html">installation instructions for database connectivity</a>.
<p>
First, you need to install the Glasgow Haskell
Compiler, <a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/">ghc</a>.  Optionally,
if you want to modify the XQuery parser, you need to install the
parser generator for Haskell,
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/happy/">happy</a>.  Then,
download <a href="/HXQ-0.16.0.tar.gz">HXQ version 0.16.0</a> and untar
it (using <tt>tar xfz</tt> on Linux/Mac
or <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7z x</a> on Windows).  Then,
you execute the following commands inside the HXQ directory:
<pre>
runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
runhaskell Setup.lhs build
runhaskell Setup.lhs install
</pre>
On linux, the last command must be run as root.
HXQ consists of the executable <tt>xquery</tt>, which is the XQuery interpreter, and the
HXQ library.  To use the HXQ library in a Haskell program,
simply <tt>import Text.XML.HXQ.XQuery</tt>.

<h2>Current Status</h2>
<p>
HXQ supports most essential XQuery features, although some system
functions are missing (but are easy to add).  
Note that HXQ is a proof-of-concept (prototype) implementation; it's not
fully compliant with the W3C specs. One may use HXQ as a basis
for a fully compliant XQuery implementation (conforming to W3C test suits),
but currently I do not have the time to do so. To see the list of
supported system functions, run <tt>xquery -help</tt>. Here are
some important differences between HXQ and the W3C specs:
<ul>
<li> HXQ does not do static typechecking and ignores function types,
although it supports type testing and casting using
the XQuery expressions: typeswitch, instance-of, cast-as, etc.
<li> HXQ provides very little support for namespaces. For example, two QNames,
<tt>s1:tag</tt> and <tt>s2:tag</tt>, are different in HXQ
even when <tt>s1</tt> and <tt>s2</tt> are different prefixes
of the same namespace.
<li> The XQuery semantics requires duplicate elimination and
sorting by document order for every XPath step, which is very
expensive and unnecessary in most cases.  This is not currently
supported by HXQ but will be addressed in the future (needs a static
analysis to determine when duplicate elimination is necessary).  For
example, <tt>e//*//*</tt> may return duplicate elements in HXQ.
<li> Currently, the <tt>doc</tt> function works on local
XML documents only, rather than general URIs. This can be easily fixed
by using the Haskell Network.HTTP.Simple library.
</ul>

<h2>Using the Compiler</h2>
<p>
The main functions for embedding XQueries in Haskell are:
<ul>
<li> <tt>$(xe query) :: XSeq</tt>
<li> <tt>$(xq query) :: IO XSeq</tt>
</ul>
where <tt>query</tt> is a string value (a Haskell expression that
evaluates to a string <b>at compile-time</b>). They both translate the
query into Haskell code, which is compiled and optimized into machine
code directly.  The code that xe generates has type <tt>XSeq</tt> (a
sequence of XML trees of type <tt>[XTree]</tt>) while the code that xq
generates has type <tt>(IO XSeq)</tt>. If the query reads a
document (using doc(...)) or calls an external function, then you should use xq since it requires
IO. You can use the value of a Haskell variable <tt>v</tt> inside
a query using <tt>$v</tt> as long as <tt>v</tt> has
type <tt>XSeq</tt>.  To call a function in a query, it should be
defined in Haskell with type <tt>(XSeq,...,XSeq) -&gt IO XSeq</tt>.
<p>
Here is an example of a main program:
<pre>
f(x,y) = $(xq "&lt;article&gt;&lt;first&gt;{$x}&lt;/first&gt;&lt;second&gt;{$y}&lt;/second&gt;&lt;/article&gt;")

main = do a &lt;- $(xq "&lt;result&gt;{                                                         /
                 /       for $x at $i in doc('data/dblp.xml')//inproceedings           /
                 /       where $x/author = 'Leonidas Fegaras'                          /
                 /       order by $x/year descending                                   /
                 /       return &lt;paper&gt;{ $i, ') ', $x/booktitle/text(),                /
                 /                       ': ', $x/title/text()                         /
                 /              }&lt;/paper&gt;                                              /
                 /    }&lt;/result&gt;                                                       ")
          putXSeq a
          b &lt;- $(xq " f( $a/paper[10], $a/paper[8] ) ")
          putXSeq b
</pre>
Another example, can be found in <a href="Test1.hs">Test1.hs</a>. You compile it using
<tt>ghc -O2 --make Test1.hs -o a.out</tt>.
Using the latest ghc (version >= 6.9), one may use <a href="http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Quasiquotation">quasi-quotations</a>
instead of strings, as is shown in <a href="Test2a.hs">Test2a.hs</a>.
<p>
You can compile an XQuery file into a Haskell program
(<tt>Temp.hs</tt>) using <tt>xquery -c file</tt>. Or better, you can
use the script <tt>compile</tt> (on Unix/Mac or Windows) to compile the XQuery file
to an executable. For example:
<pre>
compile data/q1.xq
</pre>
will compile the XQuery file <a href="data/q1.xq">data/q1.xq</a> into the executable <tt>a.out</tt>.
<p>
<h2>Using the Interpreter</h2>
<p>
The HXQ interpreter is far more slower than the compiler; use it only
if you need to evaluate ad-hoc XQueries read from input or from files.
The only function is:
<pre>
xquery :: String -&gt; IO XSeq
</pre>
which evaluates an XQuery in a string.
The HXQ interpreter doesn't recognize Haskell variables and functions
(but you may declare XQuery variables and functions using the XQuery
'declare' syntax). The main HXQ program, called <tt>xquery</tt>,
evaluates an XQuery in a file using the interpreter. For example:
<pre>
xquery data/q1.xq
</pre> Without an argument, it reads and evaluates XQueries and
variable/function declarations from input.  With <tt>xquery -p
xpath-query xml-file</tt> you can evaluate an XPath query against an XML
file. For example, 
<pre>
xquery -p "//inproceedings[100]" data/dblp.xml
</pre>
With <tt>xquery -help</tt> you get the list of system functions and
usage information.
